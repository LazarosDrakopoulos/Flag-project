# Flag-project

The 'CSS Flag Project' offers a demonstration of HTML and CSS techniques to replicate the flag of Laos. Through adept utilization of CSS selectors and specificity, the flag's intricate design is achieved without resorting to the addition of extraneous classes or identifiers within the HTML markup. This project serves as an educational resource, illustrating how CSS can be leveraged effectively to recreate visual elements with precision and minimalistic markup.
